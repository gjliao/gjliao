Hello everyone,

I am Guo-Jun Liao, a Ph.D. at institute of theoretical Physics, TU Berlin, Germany. I am searching for a job position as a data scientist. As a first step, I created my first repository on GitHub. I would be very grateful if you would share your knowledge and experiences in becoming a data scientist.

Thanks for your time!

Best regards, 

Guo-Jun Liao
